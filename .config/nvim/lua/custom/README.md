# Nvim Config

This is a config built on top of [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/). Make sure you have NvChad installed before proceeding.

Note that if you run into any errors using this config, ensure that you have all the dependencies installed properly. I will be compiling a list of required dependencies here soon. For now, just look at the config and figure it out yourself, thank, sry. Have nice day.
